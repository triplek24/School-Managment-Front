#### Explanation  
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School management app created using React Js. 
The main functionality of this app is to assign a teacher to the students. We can also add new student and teacher as per current scenerio. In this, datas are stored in databases so we can retrieve the teacher and students data whenever we want and we can view the teachers and students data present in the school.
