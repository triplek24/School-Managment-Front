#### Explanation  
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School management app created using React Js. 
The main functionality of this app is to assign a teacher to the students. We can also add new student and teacher as per current scenerio.
